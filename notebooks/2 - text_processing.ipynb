    "\n",
    "### Why chunk the text?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Context limit\n",
    "\n",
    "LLM's have a context limit, i.e., a maximum number of tokens they can process during inference. While recent advances have brought about commercial and open-source models with context limits in the 10's or 100's of thousands, many smaller models may not be able to fit the entire article in context. Breaking the article into chunks allows us to use smaller models which only need to read the relevant portions of the document at inference time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to serve the model the right portion of the document for a given query, we will implement a retrieval pipeline which will use an embedding model. Similar to LLM's, these embedding models have their own context windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Latency\n",
    "\n",
    "When generating a response, the LLM will need to process each input token before generating its first output token. Even if a model could fit the entire article in context, it would take much longer to respond if we asked it to read the entire article instead of just a relevant snippet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chunking Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using a fairly standard Recursive Character Text Splitting algorithm, outlined below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is to split text into chunks with:\n",
    "- A maximum chunk size (e.g., 1000 characters)\n",
    "- A minimum amount of overlap between chunks (e.g., 200 characters)\n",
    "- Preserving natural language structure, like paragraphs or sentences, wherever possible\n",
    "\n",
    "You initialize the text splitter with:\n",
    "- `separators`: Ordered list of characters to try splitting on, ordered in descending priority\n",
    "\n",
    "- `chunk_size`: Maximum size of a chunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `chunk_overlap`: Number of characters that overlap between adjacent chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm:\n",
    "1. Split the text using the first separator.\n",
    "2. Check the size of each split. For each candidate chunk:\n",
    "    - If it's smaller than or equal to chunk_size, accept it.\n",
    "    - If it's larger than chunk_size, recursively split it using the next separator in the list.\n",
    "3. Repeat Step 2 recursively until all candidate chunks are of an acceptable size. This usually leads to over-splitting.\n",
    "4. Iteratively merge candidate chunks to get as close to the `chunk_size` as possible (without going over) and meet the minimum chunk overlap requirements.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How to set parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunk Size**\n",
    "\n",
    "Downstream, I want to generate embeddings for each chunk using the [MedCPT-Article-Encoder](https://huggingface.co/ncbi/MedCPT-Article-Encoder), an embedding model that was trained on abstracts from PubMed (more on this below). Because this model was trained on abstracts, I want to make each chunk roughly the same length as an abstract, which are usually between 150-250 words. Taking an average of 5 characters per word this give us between 750-1250 characters on average. This agrees with [this article](https://urds.uoregon.edu/symposium/abstracts) I found from the University of Oregon which gives a typical upper bound of 1500 characters for abstracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, I will use 1500 maximum chunk size.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separators**\n",
    "\n",
    "I used the standard list of separators for this library, except I added `\". \"` to try to force more splits at the end of sentences. The goal being to make sure each chunk is interpretable on its own, since the llm won't be able to look back/ahead to get more context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chunk Overlap**\n",
    "\n",
    "I set this to 150 characters which roughly equals a sentence or two of overlap. Again, the goal being to make each chunk interpretable on its own."

      "HE EVIDENCE LINKING PROTO-ONCOGENES TO THE INDUC- tion or maintenance of human malignancies is largely cir- cumstantial, but has become increasingly compelling. This circumstantial evidence is derived from studies of animal models, tumor cell lines, and actual human tumors. Data from animal models and cell lines include: (i) sequence homology between human proto- oncogenes and the viral oncogenes of transforming retroviruses that are known to be tumorigenic in some species (1, 2); (ii) transfction studies showing the transforming potential of proto-oncogenes m NIH 3T3 cells and primary embryo fibroblasts (3-5); and (iii) the central role of certain proto-oncogenes in tumorigenesis by chronic transforming retroviruses such as avian leukosis virus (6). Data from human tumors include: (i) increased expression of specific proto- oncogenes in some human malignancies (7, 8); (ii) localization of proto-oncogenes at or near the site of specific, tumor-associated chromosomal translocations (9); and (iii) amplification of proto- oncogenes in some human tumors (10, 11). Additional data linking proto-oncogenes to cell growth is their expression in response to certain proliferation signals (12, 13) and their expression during embryonic development (14, 15). More direct evidence comes from the fact that, of the 20 known proto- oncogenes, three are related to a growth factor or a growth factor receptor.\n",

      "Content:\n",
      "More direct evidence comes from the fact that, of the 20 known proto- oncogenes, three are related to a growth factor or a growth factor receptor. These genes include c-sis, which is homologous to thetransforming gene of the simian sarcoma virus and is the 1B chain of platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) (16, 17); c-fis, which is homologous to the transforming gene of the feline sarcoma virus and is closely related to the macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor (CSF-1R) (18); and c-erbB, which encodes the EGF receptor (EGFR) and is highly homologous to the transforming gene of the avian erythroblastosis virus (19). The two receptor- related proto-oncogenes, c-fins and c-erbB, are members of the tyrosine-specific protein kinase family to which many proto-onco- genes belong. Recently, a novel transforming gene was identified as a result of transfction studies with DNA from chemically induced rat neu- roglioblastomas (20). This gene, called neu, was shown to be related to, but distinct from, the c-erbB proto-oncogene (21). By means of v-erbB and human EGFR as probes to screen human genomic and complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries, two other groups indepen- dently isolated human erbB-related genes that they called HER-2 (22) and c-erbB-2 (23). Subsequent sequence analysis and chromo- somal mapping studies revealed all three genes (neu, c-erbB-2, and HER-2) to be the same (22, 24, 25).\n",

      "Content:\n",
      "Subsequent sequence analysis and chromo- somal mapping studies revealed all three genes (neu, c-erbB-2, and HER-2) to be the same (22, 24, 25). A fourth group, also using v- erbB as a probe, identified the same gene in a mammary carcinoma cell line, MAC 117, where it was found to be amplified five- to ten- fold (26). This gene, which we will call HER-2/neu, encodes a new member of the tyrosine kinase family; and is dosely related to, but distinct from, the EGFR gene (22). HER-2/neu differs from EGFR in that itis found on band q21 of chromosome 17 (22, 24, 25), as compared to band pll.-p13 of chromosome 7, where the EGFR gene is located (27). Also, the HER-2/neu gene generates a messenger RNA (mRNA) of 4.8 kb (22), which differs from the 5.8- and 10- kb transcipts for the EGFR gene (28). Finally, the protein encoded by the HER-2/neu gene is 185,000 daltons (21), as compared to the 170,000-dalton protein encoded by the EGFR gene. Conversely, on the basis of sequence data, HER-2/neu is more closely related to the EGFR gene than to other members of the tyrosine kinase family (22). Like the EGFR protem, HER-2/neu has an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain that includes two cysteine-rich repeat dusters, and an intracellular kinase domain (21), indicatingthat it too is likely to be a cellular receptor for an as yet unidentified ligand.\n",

      "As a result of the published data showing amplification of HER- 2/neu in a human mammary carcinoma cell line, and as part of an ongoing survey in our laboratory of proto-oncogene abnormalities in human tumors, we evaluated alterations of the HER-2/neu gene in a large series of human primary breast cancers. Our results show that amplification of this gene occurs relatively frequently in breast cancer, and that it is associated with disease relapse and overall patient survival. Factors that are known to be important in the prognosis of breast malignancies in individual patients include: size of the primary tumor, stage of disease at diagnosis, hormonal receptor status, and number of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease (positive nodes) (29). The current study, which was conducted in two parts, involved the evaluation of tissue from 189 separate breast malignan- cies that were part of a breast cancer study ongoing at the University of Texas, San Antonio. This cohort of tumors was of interest because considerable information was available on the majority of the specimens including size of the primary tumor, estrogen recep- tor status, progesterone receptor status, age of patient, disease stage, and status of the axillary lymph nodes. In the initial survey, tissue from 103 primary breast cancers was evaluated for alterations in the HER-2/neu gene.\n",

This is one of the main benefits of this algorithm over other common approaches (such as KeyBERT, RAKE, YAKE) which only return single words.

    "`MedCPT` consists of two embedding models: [MedCPT-Article-Encoder](https://huggingface.co/ncbi/MedCPT-Article-Encoder) and [MedCPT-Query-Encoder](https://huggingface.co/ncbi/MedCPT-Query-Encoder), as well as [MedCPT-Cross-Encoder](https://huggingface.co/ncbi/MedCPT-Cross-Encoder), a cross-encoder model for reranking the results of a vector similarity nearest neighbor search. These models were trained on PubMed article abstracts using 255M + query-articles pairs drawn from real user data. \n",
    "\n",
    "The benefits of MedCPT are:\n",
    "- **Trained on medical language**: the given article contains lots of medical jargon that general purpose embedding models may not have encountered as much during training. As a result, these models may struggle when used for retrieval on our data.\n",
    "- **Includes CrossEncoder for ReRanking**: Many [studies]((https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10711642)) and [guides](https://weaviate.io/blog/cross-encoders-as-reranker?utm_source=chatgpt.com) suggest that using cross-encoders to do this reranking improve search result accurracy for RAG systems. I have also seen this improvement firsthand in my prior work.\n",
    "- **Lightweight**: the models are only 109M parameters, making them much lighter than state of the art general purpose embedding models. For reference, of the Top 10 embedding models on the [MTED Leaderboard](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mteb/leaderboard), 9 of the 10 models are confirmed or suspected to be over *7 Billion parameters* (with some greatly exceeding that number). This is particularly important for this prototype as we possess limited GPU RAM, most of which will be consumed by the text generation model.\n",

      "Chunk: The incidence of EGFR amplification and rearrangement was too small to attempt statistical correlation. Comparison of HER-2/ neu amplification (53/189 or 28%) with that of the EGFR gene reveals the incidence of the former to be 14 times greater than that of the latter, indicating that the phenomenon of gene amplification is not a general one for a related tyrosine kinase-specific receptor in human breast cancer. Moreover, studies examining alterations of two other tyrosine kinase-specific proto-oncogenes, abi andfes, in breast cancer did not show amplification of these genes (33). Alterations of non-tyrosine kinase-related proto-oncogenes in thesereceptors in the biology of breast cancer is well established (29, 39, 40). It is easy to speculate that a gene encoding a putative growth factor receptor, when expressed in inappropriate amounts, may give a growth advantage to the cells expressing it. Alternatively, alter- ation in the gene product itself may lead to a critical change in the receptor protein. A single point mutation in the transmembrane domain of the protein encoded by the rat neu oncogene appears to be all that is necessary for the gene to gain transforming ability (41). Whether this or a similar alteration is found in the amplified HER- 21neu gene in human breast cancer will require sequence analysis of the homologous region in the amplified human gene.\n",

      "Chunk: Subsequent sequence analysis and chromo- somal mapping studies revealed all three genes (neu, c-erbB-2, and HER-2) to be the same (22, 24, 25). A fourth group, also using v- erbB as a probe, identified the same gene in a mammary carcinoma cell line, MAC 117, where it was found to be amplified five- to ten- fold (26). This gene, which we will call HER-2/neu, encodes a new member of the tyrosine kinase family; and is dosely related to, but distinct from, the EGFR gene (22). HER-2/neu differs from EGFR in that itis found on band q21 of chromosome 17 (22, 24, 25), as compared to band pll.-p13 of chromosome 7, where the EGFR gene is located (27). Also, the HER-2/neu gene generates a messenger RNA (mRNA) of 4.8 kb (22), which differs from the 5.8- and 10- kb transcipts for the EGFR gene (28). Finally, the protein encoded by the HER-2/neu gene is 185,000 daltons (21), as compared to the 170,000-dalton protein encoded by the EGFR gene. Conversely, on the basis of sequence data, HER-2/neu is more closely related to the EGFR gene than to other members of the tyrosine kinase family (22). Like the EGFR protem, HER-2/neu has an extracellular domain, a transmembrane domain that includes two cysteine-rich repeat dusters, and an intracellular kinase domain (21), indicatingthat it too is likely to be a cellular receptor for an as yet unidentified ligand.\n",

      "Chunk: To determine if amplification of HER-2/neu was independent of other known prognostic factors in predicting disease behavior, multivariate survival analyses were performed on the 86 node- positive cases. Amplification of the gene continued to be a strong prognostic factor, providing additional and independent predictive information on both time to relapse and overall survival in thesepatients, even when other prognostic factors were taken into account (Table 4). Rearrangement of the HER-2/neu gene was rare. Of the total 189 tumors evaluated, three showed evidence of rearrangement, and in two of the three cases, the rearrangement was identical (Fig. 1, cases 77 to 79). Also, two of the rearranged HER-2/neu loci were amplified (Fig. 1, cases 78 and 79). The incidence of HER-2/neu rearrangement as determined by Eco RI digestion was too small to attempt statistical correlations. To determine whether the phenomenon of amplification of HER- 21neu in breast cancer extended to related growth factor receptors, all filters were analyzed with the EGFR probe (Fig. 4). Amplifica- tion of the EGFR gene was found in 4/189 (2%) of the cases, and rearrangement of the EGFR gene was found in one of those four cases. The incidence of EGFR amplification and rearrangement was too small to attempt statistical correlation.\n",

      "Chunk: In addition, studies evaluating the expression of this gene at the RNA and/or protein level will prove important in determining if HER-2/neu amplification results in an expected increased gene expression. The question of amplification of HER-2/neu in metastatic as compared to primary lesions in a given patient is important. The current study utilized only primary breast tumors for analyses. It would be of interest to determine if HER-2/neu copy number is altered as the tumor metastasizes. A recent study evaluating N-myc copy number in human small cell carcinoma of the lung showed no difference between primary and metastatic lesions (11). The initial survey from the current study showed that 15% of breast cancer patients with stage I disease (node-negative) have HER-2/ncu amplification. Unfortunately, no long-term follow-up data were available for these patients. This stage I setting may be an additional group in which HER-2/neu measurements will have an impact in predicting biologic behavior of the tumor, and as a result, in design of treatment strategy. Finally, if the HER-2/neu gene product functions as a growth factor receptor that plays a role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer, identification of its ligand and development of specific antagonists could have important therapeu- tic implications.\n",

      "Chunk: As a result of the published data showing amplification of HER- 2/neu in a human mammary carcinoma cell line, and as part of an ongoing survey in our laboratory of proto-oncogene abnormalities in human tumors, we evaluated alterations of the HER-2/neu gene in a large series of human primary breast cancers. Our results show that amplification of this gene occurs relatively frequently in breast cancer, and that it is associated with disease relapse and overall patient survival. Factors that are known to be important in the prognosis of breast malignancies in individual patients include: size of the primary tumor, stage of disease at diagnosis, hormonal receptor status, and number of axillary lymph nodes involved with disease (positive nodes) (29). The current study, which was conducted in two parts, involved the evaluation of tissue from 189 separate breast malignan- cies that were part of a breast cancer study ongoing at the University of Texas, San Antonio. This cohort of tumors was of interest because considerable information was available on the majority of the specimens including size of the primary tumor, estrogen recep- tor status, progesterone receptor status, age of patient, disease stage, and status of the axillary lymph nodes. In the initial survey, tissue from 103 primary breast cancers was evaluated for alterations in the HER-2/neu gene.\n",
